# -Astrobiogenesis-Simulator-Where-did-the-genetic-Code-really-come-from-
Explore DNA and RNA survival on other worlds with this Streamlit simulator. Adjust temperature, pH, minerals, and energy sources to model environments from Mars to Europa. Interactive animations show how nucleic acids persist or decay, illustrating prebiotic chemistry across cosmic time.

## Planet Presets

* **Mars Surface** – Cold, dry, low pressure
* **Europa Ocean** – Subsurface ocean, moderate salts
* **Titan Lake** – Liquid methane, low temperature
* **Hot Spring** – High temperature, mineral-rich
* **Deep Space** – Vacuum, extreme cold
